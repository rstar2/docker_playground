# Things to do

- Add real books data using plain REST
- Fix creation of the ElasticSearch index (books) with the necessary analyzers and properties (boost for title and etc)
- Allow adding of new book from the client - e.g. upload and let NodeJS put it in ElasticSearch
- ~~Update the ElasticSearch NodeJS client~~
